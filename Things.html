Start talking!Wait, did my partner jump out the window(or crash through the window)? Did they try to... MAKE A INTRODUCTION WITHOUT ME!!! HE KNOWS WE COULD GET FIRED IF HE DOES IT WITHOUT ME!!!Okay, calm down. I just need to find him, and tell him to wipe out your brain memory. Wait he left it at McDonalds last week. OH MY GOD!!! WHAT DID HE TELL YOU, WAS IT WEIRD OR BAD!? YOU KNOW WHAT DON'T TELL ANYONE WHAT HE TOLD YOU! PROMISE!!! WHY AREN'T YOu talking? Am I talking to a mime right now? Okay i'm done. I'm going back to bed. By the way, i'm sorry about the links. I am just to lazy to fix it. Wait! I dont need you to promise me to tell this to anyone because your a mime! You can't talk. And if you do start talking, <span style="color:red">I am gonna make you wish you never spoke a word again.</span> Ok have a good day or night, wherever weird place you live. I expect France. Now get out here, and don't come back. Thank you. Why are you still here? LEAVE! It's over! Were done talking! You are really getting on my nerves Mr. Mime Man. You won't leave will you. Are you deaf or something? Or are you just trying to make me through you out the window!? What do you want? I am just a guy who hates small talk. Ok, I have three words for you. Are you listening? Okay, ready. LEAVE. ME. ALONE. You are still here. I just want you to leave. That is it. It's not that hard to do. You just use your legs to walk out of here or your invisible bike to ride out of here. The door is down the hall to your left. get out.     </p>
